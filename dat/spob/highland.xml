  <description>One of the few industrial backbones of what was the Yetmer-O'rez family, it has long since switched to become the primary supplier of weapons and ships to House O'rez. There are many military checkpoints throughout the planet, and many of the factories have strict access controls to try to minimize sabotage and spies, which it seems like they had significant problems with at the beginning of the war.</description>
  <bar>The Highland Cafe is not quite up to the pre-war standards, however, the portions are surprisingly generous. Most patrons pilots from transport ships, with an occasional military pilot mixed in here and there. The ambient is quite somber, as if everyone has things to do and places to be that don't allow them to fully relax.</bar>
