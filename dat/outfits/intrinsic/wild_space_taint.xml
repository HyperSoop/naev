  <description>The ship seems to have been tainted by whatever is subverting people into the Lost you met in Wild Space. It has spread completely throughout the ship, significantly complicating life support systems, for which only a reduced crew can be used. Although it has a tendency to make the ship show up much more on sensors, it apparently seems to significantly harden the hull against the nebula radiation.</description>
