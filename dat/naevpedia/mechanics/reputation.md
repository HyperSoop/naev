# Reputation

Reputation represents how well you are liked by each [faction](lore/factions).
Increasing your reputation with a specific faction can give you access to more of their [outfits](outfits), [ships](ships), and spaceports.
With sufficient reputation, a faction will see you as friendly, changing how their ships behave near you.
On the other hand, lowering your reputation can lead to a faction seeing you as an enemy, barring you from their spaceports and attacking you on sight.

Your current reputation standings can be seen from the information menu that you can open with the <%= "#b"..naev.keyGet("info").."#0" %> key.

## Changing Reputation

There are several ways to change your reputation with a faction:

1. [Doing missions](mechanics/missions)
1. Attacking or [boarding](mechanics/boarding) ships

Reputation changes will propagate to allies and enemies of the faction your reputation is changing with.
For example, although attacking a faction will decrease your standing with them, attacking an enemy of a faction will increase your standing with them.

## Reputation Limits

Each faction has a maximum level of reputation you can reach.
This maximum will be increased as you perform specific [missions](mechanics/missions) for the faction.
