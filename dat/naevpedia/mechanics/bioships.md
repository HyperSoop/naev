# Bioships

Bioships are hybrid between man-made constructs and living animals, and are tamed and created by the [Soromid Tribes](factions/soromid).
Unlike normal ships, bioships have built-in cores that grow stronger as the ship gains ranks.
Increasing ranks can be done by gaining experience, primarily through doing missions with the ship.
Other than improving the core outfits, ranks allows the ship to learn new skills and become significantly more powerful.

## Skills

Bioship skills, ranks, and other information can be seen from the #bInformation window#0, which can be opened with the <%= "#b"..naev.keyGet("info").."#0" %> key.
You can also reset the skills by using experience, although this can lower your rank.
